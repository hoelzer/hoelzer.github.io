Polymers are versatile, durable, and cost-effective materials essential in packaging, construction, and electronics. Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties. The aim of this postdoctoral position is to correlate the molecular properties of fluid mixtures in a microporous polymer with its large-scale permeability and selectivity.\nStarting date February 2025, or after.\nApply.

By analyzing the viral genetic material present in wastewater, public health officials can gain early insights into the spread of the virus and inform timely intervention measures. The construction of reference datasets from known SARS-CoV-2 lineages and their mutation profies has become state-of-the-art for assigning viral lineages and their relative abundances from wastewater sequencing data. However, the selection of reference sequences or mutations directly affects the predictive power. **Results** Here, we show the impact of a mutation- and sequence-based reference reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation. We benchmark three data sets: 1) synthetic “spike-in” mixtures, 2) German samples from early 2021, mainly comprising Alpha, and 3) samples obtained from wastewater at an international airport in Germany from the end of 2021, including 1rst signals of Omicron. The two approaches differ in sub-lineage detection, with the marker-mutation-based method, in particular, being challenged by the increasing number of mutations and lineages. However, the estimations of both approaches depend on selecting representative references and optimized parameter settings. By performing parameter escalation experiments, we demonstrate the effects of reference size and alternative allele frequency cutoffs for abundance estimation. We show how different parameter settings can lead to different results for our test data sets, and illustrate the effects of virus lineage composition of wastewater samples and references. **Conclusions** Here, we compare a mutation- and sequence-based reference construction and assignment for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation from wastewater samples. Our study highlights current computational challenges, focusing on the general reference design, which significantly and directly impacts abundance allocations. We illustrate advantages and disadvantages that may be relevant for further developments in the wastewater community and in the context of higher standardization.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of reference design on estimating SARS-CoV-2 lineage abundances from wastewater sequencing data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kevin Lamkiewicz","Lisa-Marie Barf","Konrad Sachse","**Martin Hölzer**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719792e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719792e3,"objectID":"51b80a8be0385fb347286017101b785b","permalink":"https://hoelzer.github.io/publication/2024-ribap.html","publishdate":"2024-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-ribap.html","section":"publication","summary":"Microbial pangenome analysis identifies present or absent genes in prokaryotic genomes.

These observations have sparked widespread interest in developing computational strategies that support the comprehensive characterisation of viral communities based on sequencing data. Here we introduce VIRify, a new computational pipeline designed to provide a user-friendly and accurate functional and taxonomic characterisation of viral communities. VIRify identifies viral contigs and prophages from metagenomic assemblies and annotates them using a collection of viral profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). These include our manually-curated profile HMMs, which serve as specific taxonomic markers for a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral taxa and are thus used to reliably classify viral contigs. We tested VIRify on assemblies from two microbial mock communities, a large metagenomics study, and a collection of publicly available viral genomic sequences from the human gut. The results showed that VIRify could identify sequences from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, and provided taxonomic classifications from the genus to the family rank with an average accuracy of 86.6%. In addition, VIRify allowed the detection and taxonomic classification of a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses present in 243 marine metagenomic assemblies. Finally, the use of VIRify led to a large expansion in the number of taxonomically classified human gut viral sequences and the improvement of outdated and shallow taxonomic classifications. Overall, we demonstrate that VIRify is a novel and powerful resource that offers an enhanced capability to detect a broad range of viral contigs and taxonomically classify them.","tags":null,"title":"VIRify: an integrated detection, annotation and taxonomic classification pipeline using virus-specific protein profile hidden Markov models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Update. The offer has now expired, and the selection process has moved to the next step.\nScope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate.

Assembly and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) metrics for both microbes and viruses were determined from an Illumina-only assembly, ONT-only assembly, and a hybrid assembly approach. The hybrid approach recovered 2× more mid to high-quality MAGs compared to the Illumina-only approach and 4× more than the ONT-only approach. A similar number of viral genomes were reconstructed using the hybrid and ONT methods, and both recovered nearly fourfold more viral genomes than the Illumina-only approach. While yielding fewer MAGs, the ONT-only approach generated MAGs with a high probability of containing rRNA genes, 3× higher than either of the other methods. Of the shared MAGs recovered from each method, the ONT-only approach generated the longest and least fragmented MAGs, while the hybrid approach yielded the most complete.

Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. **Conclusions** We recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly.","tags":null,"title":"De novo transcriptome assembly: A comprehensive cross-species comparison of short-read RNA-Seq assemblers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Martin Hölzer**","Verena Krähling","Fabian Amman","Emanuel Barth","Stephan H Bernhart","Victor AO Carmelo","Maximilian Collatz","Gero Doose","Florian Eggenhofer","Jan Ewald","Jörg Fallmann","Lasse M Feldhahn","Markus Fricke","Juliane Gebauer","Andreas J Gruber","Franziska Hufsky","Henrike Indrischek","Sabina Kanton","Jörg Linde","Nelly Mostajo","Roman Ochsenreiter","Konstantin Riege","Lorena Rivarola-Duarte","Abdullah H Sahyoun","Sita J Saunders","Stefan E Seemann","Andrea Tanzer","Bertram Vogel","Stefanie Wehner","Michael T Wolfinger","Rolf Backofen","Jan Gorodkin","Ivo Grosse","Ivo Hofacker","Steve Hoffmann","Christoph Kaleta","Peter F Stadler","Stephan Becker","Manja Marz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475798400,"objectID":"99e163b9ef5191650a5ed57d6c937a73","permalink":"https://hoelzer.github.io/publication-do-not-show/2016-rnaseq-ebola.html","publishdate":"2016-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication-do-not-show/2016-rnaseq-ebola.html","section":"publication-do-not-show","summary":"The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa resulted in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, underlining the need for a better understanding of the biology of this highly pathogenic virus to develop specific counter strategies. Two filoviruses, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, result in a severe and often fatal infection in humans. However, bats are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without obvious symptoms. The molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. We report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death. We used comparative transcriptomics to provide a data resource that can be used to identify cellular responses that might allow bats to survive filovirus infections.","tags":null,"title":"Differential transcriptional responses to Ebola and Marburg virus infection in bat and human cells","type":"publication-do-not-show"}]
