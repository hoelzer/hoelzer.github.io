Polymers are versatile, durable, and cost-effective materials essential in packaging, construction, and electronics. Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) represent a special class with rigid ring-shaped molecules forming interconnected voids of 0.2 to 2 nanometers. PIMs have high specific surface areas and are scalable, making them ideal for gas adsorption and mixture separation. However, only a few fluid mixtures can currently be separated using nanoporous materials, with most methods still relying on costly thermal processes such as distillation. Developing new nanopore-based separation processes could address environmental issues such as water contamination and CO2 emissions. To facilitate the emergence of these new processes, a better understanding of the complex behaviors of nanoconfined fluid mixtures is crucial. Achieving this goal requires novel multiscale approaches to connect the molecular details of confined molecules at the nanoscale to macroscopic transport properties. The aim of this postdoctoral position is to correlate the molecular properties of fluid mixtures in a microporous polymer with its large-scale permeability and selectivity.\nStarting date February 2025, or after.\nApply.

The offer has now expired, and the selection process has moved to the next step.\nScope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate. The PhD candidate should have a background in physics, physical chemistry/chemical physics or materials science. He/she should also have some experience in scientific programming and a background in statistical mechanics (including if possible Monte Carlo or/and Molecular Dynamics).\nPractical aspects. The position is available starting January 2024 and lasts for 36 months.

In particular, for non-model organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome, RNA-Seq is used to reconstruct the transcriptome de novo. Although the de novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are frequently developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which assembly software should be used to build a comprehensive de novo assembly. **Results** Here, we present a large-scale comparative study in which 10 de novo assembly tools are applied to 9 RNA-Seq data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built \u003e200 single assemblies and evaluated their performance on a combination of 20 biological-based and reference-free metrics. Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and extensible Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly execution instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes, and Trans-ABySS, followed by Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans, generally outperformed the other tools compared. Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. **Conclusions** We recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly.","tags":null,"title":"De novo transcriptome assembly: A comprehensive cross-species comparison of short-read RNA-Seq assemblers","type":"publication"}]
