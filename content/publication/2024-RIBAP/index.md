abstract: "Microbial pangenome analysis identifies present or absent genes in prokaryotic genomes. However, current tools are limited when analyzing species with higher sequence diversity or higher taxonomic orders such as genera or families. The Roary ILP Bacterial core Annotation Pipeline (RIBAP) uses an integer linear programming approach to refine gene clusters predicted by Roary for identifying core genes. RIBAP successfully handles the complexity and diversity of Chlamydia, Klebsiella, Brucella, and Enterococcus genomes, outperforming other established and recent pangenome tools for identifying all-encompassing core genes at the genus level. RIBAP is a freely available Nextflow pipeline at github.com/hoelzer-lab/ribap and zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10890871."
